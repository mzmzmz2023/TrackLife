**TrackLife**

TrackLife is a computational pipeline designed for detecting and tracking cells from time-lapse microscopy images. 

By addressing challenges such as diverse cell shapes and sizes, low image contrast, noise, and dynamic movements, TrackLife helps in gaining quantitative insights into cell behavior, movement, and division. These insights are critical for advancing research in developmental biology, cancer studies, and microbiology. 

The pipeline integrates robust image segmentation techniques with efficient cell tracking algorithms, such as the watershed method and the Hungarian algorithm, to handle complex datasets.
